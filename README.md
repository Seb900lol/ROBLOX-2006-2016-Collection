IMPORTANT: Antivirus Disclaimer
Some users have been reporting that their antivirus programs are flagging this as malicious. This is due to the current antivirus ecosystem flagging effectively everything that isn't signed code as malicious if it performs any activities that are deemed as such, even if those actions are non-malicious (such as writing to the Windows registry, writing files in the background, or downloading any data on the network).
Roblox unfortunately did not sign the executable when this was compiled in March of 2007, hence why these warnings are appearing. This should be cleared once the executable is submitted for manual analysis, but for now you'll need to make an exception if any sort of anti-virus alarm is raised.

IN SUMMARY, this is a misdiagnosis and there should be nothing to worry about. But please do make sure to heed some of the security warnings listed below.

Requirements
For this to execute correctly, you need to make sure your system has the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack installed. This pack was standard in most older systems, but newer systems are no longer bundled with it.

You can find it here:

(Note: You will need the x86 pack. It may also help to have the x64 pack as well.)
